Matrix Operations Tool - Python
This Python project provides an interactive tool for performing common matrix operations using the NumPy library. It allows users to input matrices and perform operations such as:

Matrix Addition
Matrix Subtraction
Matrix Multiplication
Transpose of a matrix
Determinant calculation (for square matrices)
The tool offers an easy-to-use, text-based interface where users can input matrix dimensions and values row by row, and then select an operation to perform. Results are displayed clearly in a structured matrix format.

Features:
Addition: Add two matrices of the same dimensions.
Subtraction: Subtract one matrix from another (same dimensions required).
Multiplication: Multiply two matrices (number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix).
Transpose: Get the transpose of any matrix.
Determinant: Calculate the determinant of a square matrix.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
NumPy library


Example Usage:
Addition: Adds two matrices of equal size.
Transpose: Flips the matrix along its diagonal.
Determinant: Computes the determinant of a square matrix.
